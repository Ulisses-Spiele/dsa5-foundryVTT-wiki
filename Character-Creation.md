# Character creation  

To play DSA with your friends all the players need to have a character in Foundry.
If you already have existing characters you can transfer them manually to Foundry. 
Just create a character, enter your experience level and copy all the data to your character sheet. Automated imports are planned for a future release.

If you do not yet have characters you can either use the prepared characters from the TDE Core Rules (DSA Grunderegelwerk) module or create new ones in Foundry.


## How do I create characters in Das Schwarze Auge/The Dark Eye?  

Go to the Actors Directory and create a new character:

If you have purchased the TDE Core Rules (DSA Grunderegelwerk) modules, the character creation is based on the character creation explained in the rulebook: 
1. First go to the Eigenschaften tab and enter APs for your character, e.g. 1100.

2. Next go to the Compendium Packs and select your Species from the compendium Species by dragging it from the Compendium to your sheet.
