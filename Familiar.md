To create a familiar for your witch you have to create a new actor using the creature sheet. Alternatively, you can take a predefined animal from the core modul or any other modul (f.e. a cat).

Then you have to add an animal trait (Eigenschaft (Tier)) named "Familiar" (english) or "Vertrauter" (deutsch). Make sure the name of the advantage is exactly spelled like that. This trait is ready in the core module.

Once you have added the trait to your creature it gains the additional stats that are common for familiars and it also gains the ability to use experience points. Make sure to add some and start advancing your new/old friend.

Using the familiar in Foundry as an extra token can create really fun scenarios :)
